audio2image_process.py and image2tensor_process.py are used to transfer free spoken digit dataset (FSDD is available in https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset) into the same size data like MNIST, so that they can share the same input layer. myTensorX.pt and myTensorY.pt store the result after transfer. Respectively, myTensorX.pt is the data and myTensorY.pt is the label.

Multimodal leraning use FSDD and MNIST as the multimodal dataset. Unlike normal CNN, SNN has a time dimension. We use a 128 steps simulation for each input data of MNIST or FSDD. We train this neual network with two dataset at the same time. early_fusion_SNN_based_on_gate_tunable_memritor.py is the code for early fusion neural network as our work, while conventional_late_fusion_SNN.py is only a control group. In our artical, we mentioned that neuron memristors have different fire ratio and fire current under different back gate voltage. We give different neuron different activation based on whether it is MNIST or FSDD. This new early fusion neural network gives better performance than previous research and save the hardware cost as well as the power consumption. You can get deeper insights in our article and supplementary information.
